AiiDAlab is a web platform that enables computational scientists to package scientific workflows and computational environments into "apps" and to share those apps with their collaborators and peers.

AiiDAlab builds on `AiiDA <https://www.aiida.net/>`_ as the computational workflow engine, and the `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ environment (notebooks, widgets, ...) for writing and sharing apps.
