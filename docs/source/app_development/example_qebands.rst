Build an app - AiiDA Quantum ESPRESSO bands workflow
****************************************************

Here we will have an example of how to build an AiiDAlab app that utilizes `AiiDA <https://www.aiida.net>`__ with the `AiiDA-Quantum ESPRESSO plugin <https://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/>`__ to calculate the band structure for a compound.

This represents an example of how an `AiiDA workflow <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/howto/workflows.html>`__ can be run as a turn-key solution by "wrapping" it in an AiiDAlab app.
