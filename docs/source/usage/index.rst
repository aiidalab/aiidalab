Run AiiDAlab locally
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

Linux or MacOS with `Docker installed <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`__


Instructions
------------

Clone the `AiiDAlab Docker Stack <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack>`__ repository and enter the cloned directory:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ git clone https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack
       $ cd aiidalab-docker-stack

Start AiiDAlab by running:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ ./run.sh 8888 ~/aiidalab

Feel free to choose a different port and directory (path needs to be absolute).

The startup procedure can take a while, particularly when you run it for the first time.
Once it is done, open the link provided at the bottom of the console in your web browser.
You should now see the AiiDAlab home page.
