AiiDAlab provides for the distribution of a collection of notebooks in the form of apps through the `AiiDAlab app store`_.
These apps can be installed, updated, and removed either via the command line using the ``aiidalab`` command, or via the App store.

.. tip::

   All :fa:`terminal` **Terminal** commands shown below, can in principle also be executed directly from the host via AiiDAlab launch's ``exec`` function, for example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ aiidalab-launch exec -- aiidalab install <app-name>

Install a new app
=================

You can install new apps either using the graphical user interface via the :fa:`puzzle-piece` **App Store** or on the command line (:fa:`terminal` **Terminal**).

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: App Manager

      .. grid:: 1
         :gutter: 3
         :margin: 0
         :padding: 0

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 1: Open the App Store

            Simply open AiiDAlab in the browser and click on the :fa:`puzzle-piece` icon in the top navigation bar.

            .. image:: ../_static/nav-bar-app-store.png

            This will open the app store page in a new window or tab.

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 2: Search for the app you would like to install

            Optionally, select one or multiple categories to filter by:

            .. image:: ../_static/app-management-app-store.png

            Then scroll down until you find the app you would like to install.
            An app that is not installed yet, will be presented like this:

            .. image:: ../_static/app-management-app-not-installed.png

            Clicking on the **Install** button will install the app and its dependencies.

            In some cases the app developers will push prereleases which can be installed by clicking on the *Include prereleases* check box.
            Use this option only if you require access to a not yet released feature or you would like to test a new app version and provide feedback to the developer(s).

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 3: Wait for the installation process to complete

            The current process for installing the app and its dependencies will be displayed via a terminal widget.
            Wait until the process has completed:

            .. image:: ../_static/app-management-app-installation-completed.png

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 4: Start the app from the start page

            The newly installed app should now show up on the start page.

            .. image:: ../_static/app-management-start-page.png

            Each app banner also shows an indicator about whether there is an update available (see screenshot above).
            To *update the app*, click on **Manage App** and then on the **Update** buttons.

   .. tab-item:: Terminal

      .. grid:: 1
         :gutter: 3
         :margin: 0
         :padding: 0

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 1: Open the Terminal

            Open the :fa:`terminal` by clicking on the corresponding icon in the nav bar.

            .. image:: ../_static/nav-bar-terminal.png

         .. grid-item-card:: Step 2: Install the app with the aiidalab command

            .. code-block:: console

               $ aiidalab install <app-name>

            Replace ``<app-name>`` with the name of the app you would like to install, e.g., ``aiidalab install quantum-espresso``.
            Use ``aiidalab search`` to search among available apps and their versions.
            Similarly, the ``aiidalab list`` lists all currently installed apps and their versions.
