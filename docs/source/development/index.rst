- `AiiDAlab Home app <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-home>`__ provides the web-interface to the service
- `AiiDAlab Docker Stack <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack>`__ is the repository containing the required info to build the `AiiDAlab docker container <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aiidalab/aiidalab-docker-stack>`__.
- `AiiDAlab App Registry <https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-registry>`__  collects applications shared by the AiiDAlab community.
