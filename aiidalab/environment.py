"""App environment specification

The specification is used to describe a reproducible environment for a
specific app, similar to the Reproducible Environment Specification (REES) [1]

[1] https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html

The following configuration files are recognized with the order of precedence
matching the order shown here:

.. glossary::

    setup.cfg
        Requirements listed as part of the [options]/install_requires field are
        parsed as pip-installable Python requirements for this app.

    requirements.txt
        Requirements listed within this file are parsed as pip-installable
        Python requirements for this app unless already parsed from the
        setup.cfg file.
